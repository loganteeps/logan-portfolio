    <h2>Flying Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I have loved planes since I first watched WWII warbird documentaries and heard stories of my great grandfather flying Spitfires, so it was an absolute thrill when I first took the controls of a Cessna 172 at age 16 out of Miami. While obviously a far cry from a Spitfire, I was hooked. I continued flying in Florida, and completed my first solo there before finishing my license out of SoCal’s John Wayne airport, one of the busiest class Charlies in the country. I had the opportunity to take off and land next to A320s and 767s, while dodging their wake turbulence. My first solo cross country flights were through LAX airspace. Since earning my private pilot license, I have flown in New England from Boston to Martha’s Vineyard, hopped around the Keys and Bahamas from Miami, and navigated 14 different airports in California. I feel fortunate to have had these experiences, and I look forward to more flying.
